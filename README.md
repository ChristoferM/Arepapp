# Arepapp 🛒🛒
This is a class project 💻🧑🏽‍🎓, in order to have a deep understanding in React and Redux. We built a small e-commerce of an Arepas store.

In this App the customer can Add, delete items in the cart. 
He can also register and login to the app to save the delivery information. 

All product, customer and order data is saved and requested from a fake JsonServer Api.
